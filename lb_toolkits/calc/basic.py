def k_index(pressure, temperature, dewpoint):
    '''
    Calculate K Index from the pressure temperature and dewpoint.

    K Index formula derived from [George1960]:
        K = (T850 - T500) + Td850 - (T700 - Td700)

    where:
    T850 is the temperature at 850 hPa
    T700 is the temperature at 700 hPa
    T500 is the temperature at 500 hPa
    Td850 is the dewpoint at 850 hPa
    Td700 is the dewpoint at 700 hPa

    Calculation of the K Index is defined as the temperature
    difference between the static instability between 850 hPa and 500 hPa,
     add with the moisture at 850hPa, then subtract from the dryness of the airmass at 700 hPa.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pressure
    temperature
    dewpoint

    Returns
    -------

    '''

def total_totals_index(pressure, temperature, dewpoint):
    '''
    Calculate Total Totals Index from the pressure temperature and dewpoint.

    Total Totals Index formula derived from [Miller1972]:
        TT = (T850 + Td850) - (2 * T500)

    where:

    T850 is the temperature at 850 hPa
    T500 is the temperature at 500 hPa
    Td850 is the dewpoint at 850 hPa

    Calculation of the Total Totals Index is defined as
    the temperature at 850 hPa plus the dewpoint at 850 hPa,
    minus twice the temperature at 500 hPa.
    This index consists of two components,
    the Vertical Totals (VT) and the Cross Totals (CT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pressure
    temperature
    dewpoint

    Returns
    -------

    '''

def lifted_index(pressure, temperature, parcel_profile):
    '''
    Calculate Lifted Index from the pressure temperature and parcel profile.

    Lifted index formula derived from [Galway1956] and referenced by [DoswellSchultz2006]:
        LI = T500 - Tp500

    where:
    T500 is the measured temperature at 500 hPa
     Tp500 is the temperature of the lifted parcel at 500 hPa

    Calculation of the lifted index is defined as the temperature
     difference between the observed 500 hPa temperature and the
     temperature of a parcel lifted from the surface to 500 hPa.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pressure
    temperature
    parcel_profile

    Returns
    -------
